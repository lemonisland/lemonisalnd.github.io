Success seems to be what most people are looking for in life. I think I am also looking for success. People keep saying "Strive to succeed", as if success was a clearly defined end-goal. What could it mean to be successful ? Well, it means to have a fullfilling life.
Okay, but fullfillment is another vague synonym for success, what is fullfilling ? 
Earning money is fullfilling and the rich are successful. What is so good about earning money ? Doesn't money make you anxious and unpleasant ? Actually extremely poor people may be more anxious... But still, let's imagine two neighbours, one of them has a pool and the other one has no pool. The one with no pool is jealous of the one with a pool, particularly during the summer, where he sees his neighbour's family splashing around. On the other hand, the one who owns the pool always thinks that having a pool is annoying, taking care of it is tiring, etc... But he doesn't regret having purchased it either. Why ? Because that is what makes him successful. You mean the pool in itself ? No. It is a proof of his success. Ah ! There we have it ! Success is in the eye of the beholder...success is about status. STATUS. STATUS. This is the only thing we think about. In this sens, success doesn't exist, even though we want to prove to ourselves and to others that it exists. An infinite quest which is bound to fail.
